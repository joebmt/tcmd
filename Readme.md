# tcmd - Functional Test Program and Framework

Simple Shell unit and functional test framework and examples.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the python click library:

```
pip install -r inc/requirements.txt
```

### Installing

Install the framework by running git clone or downloading the zip file.

```
git clone xxx
or
unzip xxx.zip
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

There are two example tests to use as templates for tcmd:

```
./tests/test_tcmd.sh
./tests/test_prg.sh
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

The framework and description looks like this:

```
.
├── bin
│   ├── b     (utility to backup files recursively)
│   └── tcmd  (functional python test tool to test any command line program)
├── inc
│   ├── prg_functions.sh (include file for prg.sh to run)
│   ├── requirements.txt ("pip install -r requirements.txt" for tcmd python dependencies to install)
│   └── test_utils.sh    (include file for tests/test_prg.sh to run some utility functions)
├── prg.sh    (template for a bash script; source inc/prg_functions.sh)
├── readme.md (this readme.md file)
└── tests
    ├── test_prg.sh      (functional tests for prg.sh using tcmd functional test tool)

```
